2. Site doesn't work without VPN
3. Site is clunky and cumbersome to use. i honestly really dislike how much time and how many clicks it takes to get a booking done -- clearly very little user input / usability was considered.

So I contacted our travel contact and she showed that there were hotels available. Today I attempted again and kept receiving error messages. So I refreshed and was finally able to book the hotel I wanted. Also- I sometimes book multiple destination trips, but always do two one way tickets instead because choosing multiple destinations it never shows all of the flights available. For example I want to book south west and know there are flights from Chicago to KC to Denver on SW but it doesn't show up that way. ",2,2019-03-27 14:43:47

"Hotel,Car",travelersus,"It is not a user friendly site. Doesn't allow you the capability of toggling back & forth between screens without losing things you have already booked. Even filling out this survey comment box is infuriating; the window keeps moving back & forth with each key stroke I make. I also tried booking a flight from MDW to MSP yesterday, and it only rendered Delta results when Delta was $125 more than Southwest. So I called to get the external Southwest rate to save Travelers $125+ versus opting to agree to the website & fly with Delta. Overall, I'm not impressed with the website nor the service provided when it's easier to book things personally than through this site. Unfortunate how much we probably spend as an organization & each booking fee charge of $8.50 to $13.50 just to book something through CWT when we don't have any other choice is a steep fee. Also, for the booking I made over the phone yesterday, it was a $40 CWT fee; this is absurd. I'll be calling you soon to sort this out.",2,2019-03-26 20:28:28

2. Went through the entire process only to learn the hotel had no such rooms so (with no way to back up and fix just that one item) I had to repeat everything from 'welcome' which is a needless waste of my time.

It gets more interesting when you have to select a unused ticket number to apply to a current reservation. When I go to access that, it logs me out of the current session. So now I've lost the flight, hotel and car I just searched for and additionally the copied engagement number.

So then I have to go all the way back out and come back in, and first copy the unused ticket number and then re-do all the work to paste it back in to the newly searched for flights, hotel and car.
